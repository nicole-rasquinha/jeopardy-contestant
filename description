What we'll build today

I have trivia questions
I'd like answers

Build a python program that gets a question from the user and gives us an answer.

1) Get a question from the user
	-Prompt the user
		-??? How to do this in Python?
2) Getting an answer to that question
	-Human analogy: I would Google it
	-Search Google - Use first link
		-??? How to do this in Python?
